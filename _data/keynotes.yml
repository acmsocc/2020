  title: 'Serverless in Seattle: Toward Making Serverless the Future of the Cloud'
  abstract: "The serverless computing paradigm has attractive properties, such as pay-per-use and fast scale-out.  Unfortunately, it also has some key shortcomings that have so far limited its wide applicability.  For example, current approaches for cold-start management either incur high latency or high resource overheads.  As another example, running data-intensive applications in serverless platforms is currently slow or requires additional machinery.  In this talk, I will describe our efforts towards understanding current serverless workloads, optimizing their cold start performance and efficiency, and broadening the scope of applications that can run efficiently in serverless platforms.  Some of these efforts have already started transitioning to production in Azure Functions.  I will conclude the talk with some open challenges going forward"

  title: 'Cloud Native Database Systems for Enterprise Applications'
  abstract: "Cloud native database becomes increasingly important for the era of cloud computing, due to the needs for elasticity and high availability. A cloud native database system leverages software-hardware codesign to explore accelerations offered by new hardware such as RDMA and NVM. New design architectures such as shared-storage and shared everything enable a cloud native database to decouple computation from storage and provide elasticity. For highly concurrent workloads that require horizontal scalability, a cloud native database can also leverage a shared nothing layer to provide distributed query and transaction processing. Cloud applications also require that cloud native databases to offer high availability through distributed consensus protocols.  Furthermore, The need for integrating big data processing workloads with a traditional OLAP data warehouse inside a cloud native database/data warehouse becomes increasingly imperative, so that the system can provide both real time online interactive analytics and batched offline ETL with complex computation. We will present key technical ideas towards building cloud native database systems, as well as the application and integration and big data and AI techniques in such systems"

  title: 'Towards Usability, Interactivity, and Trust for Data-Intensive Computations'
  abstract: "The abundance of data, coupled with cheap and widely-available computing and storage, has revolutionized science, industry and government alike. Now, to a large extent, the bottleneck to actionable insights lies with people. From a data management and systems perspective, this leads to several challenges including the need to build usable and scalable tools, to support the interactivity requirements for exploratory analyses, and to guide the users in data discovery and exploration. In this talk, I will present a set of techniques that aim to address these challenges by combining methods from multiple areas of computer science. I will also describe systems we have built that use these techniques to empower domain experts to explore data and build trust in the insights they derive."
