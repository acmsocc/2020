            <p align="justify">
              As a large scientific and technical community that has a direct impact on many people from
              different backgrounds around the world, Diversity and Inclusion are crucial for the data
              management community. ACM explains these goals as follows. Diversity is achieved when the
              individuals around the table are drawn from a variety of backgrounds and experience, leading to
              a breadth of viewpoints, reasoning, and approaches (also referred to as "the who"). Inclusion is
              achieved when the environment is characterized by behaviors that welcome and embrace
              diversity ("the how"). Both are important in our writing and other forms of communication such
              as posters and talks.
            </p>

            <h3>Inclusion</h3>
            <p align="justify">
              Be mindful of not using language or examples that further the marginalization,
              stereotyping, or erasure of any group of people, especially historically marginalized and/or
              under-represented groups (URGs) in computing. Of course, exclusionary or indifferent treatment
              can arise unintentionally. Be vigilant and actively guard against such issues in your writing.
              Reviewers will also be empowered to monitor and demand changes if such issues arise in your
              submissions. Here are some examples of such issues for your benefit:</p>
            </p>

            <p align="justify">
              <b>Examples of exclusionary and other non-inclusive writing to consider avoiding:</b>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Implicit assumption:</b> An example of database integrity constraints: "Every person has a
                mother and a father." This example is exclusionary and potentially hurtful to people from
                single-parent households and people with same-sex parents.
              </li>
              <li><b>Oppressive terminology:</b> Using the term "Master-Slave" to describe a distributed data
                system architecture. This can be hurtful to people whose families have suffered the
                inhumanity of enslavement. A good source of alternative terms to oppressive language
                often used in computer science can be found in <a
                  href="https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-knodel-terminology-00.html#rfc.section.1.1.1">this article</a>.
              </li>
              <li><b>Marginalization of URGs:</b> An example of attribute domains: "The Gender attribute is
                either Male or Female." This example is exclusionary and potentially hurtful to people
                who are intersex, transgender, third gender, two-spirit, agender, or have other
                non-binary gender identities.
              </li>
              <li><b>Lack of accessibility:</b> Using color alone to convey information in a plot when good
                alternative data visualization schemes exist. This can be exclusionary to people who are
                color-blind. Please consider using patterns, symbols and textures to emphasize and
                contrast visual elements in graphs and figures, rather than using colors alone. Use a
                color-blind friendly palette that is designed with accessibility for visually impaired people.
                Avoid bad color combinations such as green/red or blue/purple
              </li>
              <li><b>Stereotyping:</b> Reinforcing gender stereotypes in names or examples of roles, e.g.,
                using only feminine names or presentations for personal secretary or assistant roles.
              </li>
            </ul>
            </p>


            <h3>Diversity</h3>
            <p align="justify">
              Going further, please also consider actively raising the representation of URGs in
              your writing. Diversity of representation helps create an environment and community culture that
              could ultimately make our field more welcoming and attractive to people from URGs. This is a
              small but crucial step you can take towards celebrating and improving our communityâ€™s diversity.
            </p>

            <p align="justify">
              <b>Examples of infusing diversity into writing to consider adopting:</b>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Embracing different cultures:</b> Names of people are a visible way to enhance diversity
                of representation in writing. Instead of reusing overused names in computing such as
                Alice and Bob, consider using names from a variety of languages, cultures, and
                nationalities, e.g., Alvarez and Bano. Avail of the many online resources on this front for
                ideas, e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Names_by_culture">this article</a> on names
                across different cultures.
              </li>
              <li><b>Embracing differences in figures:</b> Depictions of people or people-like icons in
                illustrations are also a good avenue to enhance diversity of representation. Consider
                depicting people of different gender presentations, skin colors, ability status, and other
                visible attributes of people.
              </li>
              <li><b>Embracing gender diversity in pronouns:</b> Consider using a variety of gender pronouns across your
                named examples consciously, including "he/him/his," "she/her/hers," and "they/them/theirs". Likewise,
                consider using gender-neutral nouns when referring to generic roles, e.g., "chairperson" or just "chair"
                instead of "chairman," and gender-neutral pronouns for such roles.
              </li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Responsibility</h3>
            <p align="justify">
              Finally, if your work involves data-driven techniques that make decisions about
              people, please consider explicitly discussing whether it may lead to disparate impact on different
              groups, especially URGs. Consider discussing the ethical and societal implications. For
              example, see <a
                href="https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/what-are-important-ethical-implications-using-facial-recognition-technology-health-care/2019-02">this
                article</a> discussing the potential for disparate impact of facial recognition in
              healthcare and strategies to avoid or reduce harm. This <a href="http://wp.sigmod.org/?p=1900">SIGMOD Blog
                article</a> also gives a
              comprehensive overview of various dimensions and approaches for responsible application of
              data management ideas. We hope our community can help permeate this culture of
              responsibility and awareness about potentially harmful unintended negative consequences of
              our work within the larger computing landscape.
            </p>
