		The annual ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing (SoCC’20) brings together researchers, developers, users, and practitioners interested in cloud computing. ACM SoCC’20 is the 11th edition of the premier conference on cloud computing; it is the only conference co-sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Groups on Management of Data (SIGMOD) and on Operating Systems (SIGOPS). SoCC will be held in Seattle, Washington, to foster connections between the academic and industrial communities operating in the cloud space. We solicit original contributions on all aspects of cloud computing. We particularly encourage submissions on the research, development, practice, and experience of cloud computing systems and data management. Specific topics of interest include but are not limited to the following, when related to the cloud:

            <a id="submission"><h2>Submission categories</h2></a>
            <p>Authors can submit a paper in one of the following categories:</p>
			<ul class="topics-list">
			  <li>Research Papers describe original research, where novelty is a primary consideration.</li>
			  <li>Industry and System Papers describe existing, often deployed systems, 
				  where the lessons from the experience are a primary consideration.</li>
			  <li>Vision Papers describe speculative but well-reasoned and thought-provoking ideas, where 
				  insight is a primary consideration.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>
			Submissions will be judged based on their originality, technical merit,
			relevance, value to the community, and likelihood of producing interesting
			discussions at the symposium. Submissions will be kept confidential until
			accepted. Rejected submissions will be kept confidential permanently.
            </p>
		  <p> As a special type of Research Paper, we call for 
			  <b>Negative Result Papers</b> describing promising and innovative ideas that didn’t work upon 
			  rigorous evaluation.  The primary considerations when reviewing these papers will be the 
			  novelty and conceptual validity of the idea and the quality of the evaluation.</p>



            <a id="guidelines"><h2>Submission guidelines</h2></a>
            
			<p> Authors must submit original papers that are not being considered for publication in other forums. 
		    Submissions cannot be accompanied by nondisclosure, confidentiality, or similar agreements.</p>
		  
		    <p>Papers that violate the below requirements will be rejected without reviews. 
		    Judicious use of color is permitted, but the paper should print clearly in black and white. 
		    Non-rejected papers will be shepherded, and final acceptance will be conditional on the shepherd’s approval. </p>
		  
		    <p> Reviewing for <b> Research and Vision papers is double-blind </b>. 
		    Authors must make a good faith effort to anonymize their submissions, and they should not identify 
		    themselves either explicitly or by implication (e.g., through the references or acknowledgments). 
		    Submissions violating the detailed formatting and anonymization rules will not be considered for review. 
		   
        	<p> Reviewing for <b>Industry and System papers is single-blind with respect to the company/product, 
			but double blind with respect to the authors</b>.  That is, you need not anonymize the company 
			or products/services you are referring to.  However, you should not reveal the paper’s author 
			names directly in your submission.</p>
		  
		  <p>
			   If you are uncertain about how to anonymize your submission, please contact 
	           the program co-chairs (contacts at the end of the page) well in advance of the 
			  submission deadline. </p>
 

            
            <h3>Paper format & fonts</h3>
	    <p>
		Submitters are encouraged to use inclusive language and examples in their papers.  
		This includes using inclusive language in gendered nouns and pronouns (for example, 
		see this <a href="https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/gender-inclusive-language/" 
		style="color:red">article</a> on gender-inclusive language), and inclusive examples 
		when describing people (for example, see this 
		<a href="https://medium.com/@arunis100/inclusive-cs-examples-b5f40e003815" style="color:red">blogpost</a> 
		on inclusive examples).
	    </p>

            <h3>Paper format & fonts</h3>
            <p>
		    Submissions must be in PDF format using 10-point font on 12-point leading, Times-Roman or similar typeface,
		    letter-sized paper, double column, a text block of 6.5 inches wide by 9 inches tall, with numbered pages. 
		    
		    A LaTeX template is available  <a href="assets/template.tex" target="_blank" style="color:red;text-decoration:underline;">here</a>, but authors can use other templates or editors that conform with the 
		    requirements. (Please remember to suppress the author list from the submission)

            <p>
			Submissions can have up to <b>12 pages</b> for Research, Industry, and System papers, and <b>5 pages</b> for Vision papers; this limit includes the title, abstract, and appendices, but excludes references.
            </p>

            <h3>Paper type</h3>
