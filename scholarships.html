          <p> The ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing 2019 (SoCC '19) is the tenth in an established series of symposia 
		  that bring together researchers, developers, users, and practitioners interested in cloud computing. 
		  SoCC offers multiple opportunities for students to share their knowledge, experience, and research 
		  works with internationally recognized researchers from both academia and industry.</p>

	  <p> To this end, the SoCC planning committee, with the support of the National Science Fountation, ACM SIGMOD, 
		  and ACM SIGOPS, is pleased to offer travel scholarships to help students defray the costs of attending 
		  the program.  Priority will be given to students with an accepted paper at SoCC, as well as students 
		  from groups historically underrepresented at the conference.
	  </p>

	  

    <p>Applicants should be full time students (undergraduate or graduate) and will be expected to attend the full 
	    conference.  Awardees will receive a partial reimbursement for conference registration and travel expenses; 
	    The expected award is $600 to students traveling from within the US and $700 to students coming from outside 
	    the US. Priority will be given to a student with an accepted paper or poster.</p>
