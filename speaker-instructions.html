          <p> As part of our efforts at fostering diversity and inclusiveness, we request you to adhere to 
            the following guidelines on how to prepare your conference presentation. 
</p>

		  <h3> Instructions for Speakers</h3>
	  <p> <b>Design for accessibility</b>:  Color and hearing perception varies from person to person depending on 
      several factors such as age, <a href="https://nei.nih.gov/health/color_blindness/facts_about"> color blindness</a>, etc. 
      To ensure that the contents of your paper are accessible to all, consider taking the following steps:
	  </p>
		  <ul>
			  <li><p>Use patterns, symbols and textures to emphasize and contrast visual elements in graphs and figures, rather than using colors alone.
</p></li>
			  <li><p>Use a color-blind friendly palette that is designed with accessibility for visually impaired people. Avoid bad color combinations such as green/red or blue/purple.
				  </p></li>
			  <li><p>Use close captioning (real-time speech to text) in the presentation software of your 
				  choice (e.g., <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/present-with-real-time-automatic-captions-or-subtitles-in-powerpoint-68d20e49-aec3-456a-939d-34a79e8ddd5f"> MS powerpoint </a> 
				  and <a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/9109474?hl"> Google</a> slides). 
				  Also please make sure you look towards the audience while presenting your work.
</p></li>
		  </ul>

		   <p> <b>Use inclusive examples</b>:  Fine technical writing makes liberal use of examples to elucidate 
			   complex ideas. But they also offer an opportunity to promote inclusiveness by challenging 
			   common implicit assumptions and biases.
			
	  </p>
		  
		  <ul>
			  <li><p>Avoid the exclusive use of male pronouns (“he”, “his”). Consider interspersing with female (“she”, “her”) or gender-neutral (“they”, “their”) ones.
</p></li>
			  <li><p>Use gender-neutral names in examples: instead of Alice and Bob, try Alex and Jun. Consider names that reflect a variety of cultural backgrounds: Xin, Sergey, Naveena, Tuan, Esteban, Sasha, etc. The same applies to icons.</p></li>
			  <li><p>Refrain from assuming binary gender. For instance, populate a “gender” column in a table using more than just “male” and “female” values.</p></li>
			  <li><p>Be mindful of the diverse backgrounds people have: not everyone has two parents, not every married man has a wife, etc.</p></li>
			
		  </ul>

	  <h3> Instructions for Session Chairs</h3>
		  <ul>
			  <li><p>Please make sure you properly introduce the speakers before their presentation	
				  <ul>
					<li><p>Mention their names and affiliations</li></p>
				  	<li><p>Take the time to learn how to pronounce their names in case you are not sure</li></p>
		 			 <li><p>Use their preferred pronouns</li></p>
				  </ul>
			  </p></li>
			  
			  <li><p>In order to make the conference accessible to people with hearing disabilities, please remind the speakers to use close captioning (real-time speech to text) in the presentation software of their choice (e.g., <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/present-with-real-time-automatic-captions-or-subtitles-in-powerpoint-68d20e49-aec3-456a-939d-34a79e8ddd5f"> MS powerpoint </a> 
				  and <a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/9109474?hl"> Google</a> slides). 
				  Also encourage the speakers to look towards the audience while presenting their work.
</p></li>
	  <li><p>Discussion on the presented work is an integral part of the conference. To encourage participation from minorities, please make sure you accept questions from attendees with different backgrounds (e.g., senior/junior researchers, people of color, female attendees).
